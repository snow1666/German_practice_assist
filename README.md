# German_practice_assist
A desktop python application for practicing german vocabularies.

It provides the following features:
1. The ability to add and remove vocabulary words.
2. The creation of quizzes that focus on various aspects of nouns and verbs, such as gender, plural forms, and meanings.
3. Saves the user's progress and current state of the vocabulary (level of familiarity).
4. Quizzes are generated according to the level of familiarity.
5. You can also modify the theme color by adjusting the parameters in the InitStyle function in main.py.

To be able to run this application, you need Python and Tinker. I'm currently working on converting the code into an executable.
